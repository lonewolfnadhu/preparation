# 1 Explore the paradox of best practice as described by Colver (2004).

What impact does such a paradox have on the viability of management-
only strategies to deal with End User Computing Risk? Does the adoption
of best practices in other Do disciplines have unintended negative
consequences?

Answer: Paradox the word can be described as contradictory but denotes the elements that
are interrelated with one another (JSTOR, 2022). These elements are logical and isolated as
well as absurd and irrational. Sometimes they need to be managed with proper management
strategies. On the other hand, spreadsheets are electronic documents in which the data or the
elements are arranged into rows and columns so that it becomes easier to manage the data and
the elements. Also, by using the spreadsheet, the calculation and the manipulation of the data
and the elements become easy for the end users. Various spreadsheet models have greatly
improved with the help of various types of techniques that are used for the development of
those models. With the help of these models, the result can be improved as the basic
mechanical errors can be eliminated. Sometimes these spreadsheet techniques are useful, but
sometimes it is a worse idea to be used. Thus, the author Colver described in his book that
spreadsheets are not the best practice as the applications are not optimal for all spreadsheets.
End-user computer applications (EUCAs) are the reporting of programs, spreadsheets,
databases, and programming languages primarily; this area has some risks (Jamie Chambers,
John Hamill, 2022). The operational risk is one of the most important risks faced by the end
users computing as data management tools; spreadsheets can eliminate only 90% to 95% of
errors from the data or the elements; thus, some errors remain in them. The errors may be
vital for the disruption of the result of computing. However, the goal of the spreadsheet
bubble is to create and manipulate the processes so that the users can improve their
understanding and increase efficiency in the result. Because of that, it benefits research and
provides particular importance as a guideline for deploying, evaluating, and designing as a
method. Sometimes can be considered the best practices for research and analysis. However,
simultaneously the spreadsheets can help the end user&#39;s calculation with the technology and
provide some data or a generic statement as a result (UC Berkeley, 2022). In order to make a
test plan, set criteria of acceptance cannot be found in a spreadsheet. For the mathematical

and scientific theorem to depend blindly on the results accumulated from the evaluation of
the spreadsheets will never deliver a high level of accuracy. As a result, it will impose a force
to tidy up the work.
Calculations can be done with the help of particular formulae for a particular work. Manually
calculating or computing data can be more complicated rather than using spreadsheets.
Breaking up the formulae and the long calculations without any compromise with the data
and the reports spreadsheets provide are the following practical advantages(Colver, 2010)
★ The reports such as cash flows, profit and loss statements, the balance sheet,
the expenditure of organizations, surplus and depreciation, and the employee
management of a company can be calculated easily just by putting the right
data and using the accurate formulae given into the technical parts of the
spreadsheets. The formulae that are used are available in the cells of the
sheets.
★ Formulae work three-dimensionally on reports when they are placed on the
reports to do the calculations. Thus the formulas become harder to manage.
Spreadsheets that are used on the real-world model having the ability to
calculate on a single large working sheet can make the functions five to ten
times faster than working with the data or elements from the various sheets.
Although many numeric results are based on data, many consequences arise from the
theoretical advantages or disadvantages of analyzing the outcomes (Sokol, 2020). Projects
need a wider area than spreadsheets can provide because there are many stages consisting in
the project work. One of the things is that the spreadsheet models used to calculate or
evaluate for different purposes have the same kind of design in them. That is why the models
used for the different approaches must be different from one another. Otherwise, the data can
overlap while using it for different purposes simultaneously. Because of these consequences,
the various types of models consisting of various formulations should be avoided to eliminate
their complexity. Alternatively, the one model and various scenarios in it and having the
input sheets for each scenario are important for maximizing the effectiveness of the
spreadsheets used.
Nowadays, a particular circumstance that can arise with the use of spreadsheets is the safety
of input data as the banks are using them to calculate the data. Banks have to update the data
consistent with these every time it changes. However, they have to overtype the data in it and
put it into formulae without hampering its historic values. That is easier than the paperwork
to keep the historic data, but also complicated and has some data security problems. The

users should be care full while dealing with the huge amount of data in the spreadsheets.
Also, the errors that can be seen in the spreadsheets dealing with the nested functions are
errors in the selection of range and huge numbers of formulas to be handled. Therefore, the
acceleration in the use of spreadsheets that can be noticed in all sectors in the world must
have some consequences.
