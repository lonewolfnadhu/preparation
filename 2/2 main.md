# 2 Grossman and Ozluk (2004) describe spreadsheet engineering principles.

Critically evaluate this spreadsheet engineering framework, what are the
strengths and limitations of this methodological approach? What other
approaches might be suitable for a spreadsheet Engineering?
Answer: Computers have been used to help in calculations for five decades. Spreadsheets are
the programming tools of computers that help in the calculation with the help of formulas
given into it and maintaining and sorting the data as required. Spreadsheets are used to do
analytical work and have the ability of spreadsheet engineering to improve the students and
the researchers to access the management of the spreadsheet (PubsOnLine, 2022). Nowadays,
some of the accumulated knowledge of software engineering can be found in spreadsheets
(Grossman, 2022). Therefore, adapting the traditional programming techniques of software
engineering into spreadsheets is gaining popularity. The application of software engineering
principles into spreadsheets is known as spreadsheet engineering (Baltes et al. 2022).
Spreadsheet engineering can potentially increase productivity and decrease the errors that
occur due to calculation and the formulation of the data. The paradigm of spreadsheet
engineering helps to compare and contrast different types of spreadsheet engineering
recommended as the aid to the developers in selecting methodologies and helps the
researchers to understand, analyze and improve themselves. Throughout the lifecycle of a
spreadsheet providing the prescriptive recommendation is the purpose of the spreadsheet
engineering methodology. The purpose of the paradigm is to clarify and explain the main
concepts related to spreadsheet engineering. Nine paradigm elements explain spreadsheet
engineering: modelling, development parameters, design, programming, quality control,
debugging, documentation, usage, and at last, modification (Grossman, 2004). The elements
are explaining at below:
1. Modelling: Spreadsheets are the mathematical models that appear as visual
implementations of those models. As with any model, spreadsheets also deal with many
inputs and help compute or calculate a proper output. Also, the detailing of the outputs of
these sheets can be computed. Therefore the modelling of the paradigm of the spreadsheets
helps to determine the functions of the spreadsheets and helps to motivate the computation.
Moreover, these sheets are integrated with their design and programming.

2. Development parameters: planning assumptions of the spreadsheets are also addressed as
the development parameters of the spreadsheets, including the goals of the work done on the
spreadsheets are budgets (numerical figure of budget), time, developments of labour, skills,
experiences, and the likelihood and the modification of the usage and interactions at the
lifecycle of the spreadsheets. Some spreadsheets are operated by multiple users at the same
time or at different times or can be modified so that other users can use the same. For these
reasons, the poor development of the parameters causes difficulties and can generate risk
shortly. As the development parameters are used to evaluate the risk of failure in the
development and to achieve the organizational goal, it is important.
3. Design: Structural and visual design are the two types of design that consist of
spreadsheets. Structural design is the rows and the columns with a particular meaning,
modularity, and control of the space management of the spreadsheets to do the documentation
properly. The visual designs are the rows, columns, and borders that can be seen at first
glance in the spreadsheets. This design includes the shading, borders, fonts, formats, and the
appearance of the cells in these sheets.
4. Programming: Applying the formulations within the cells and creations of the other logic
in a spreadsheet, known as the programming paradigm of the spreadsheets. Programming
techniques lists are replicating the cells&#39; formulas, using accurate references in the formulas
of the cells, copying formulas rather than typing them repeatedly, creating the scenario tools
to run multiple databases, input values, and outputs, and establishing ranges by the accurate
selection of the software (Fumagalli et al. 2019).
5. Quality Control: Another paradigm of spreadsheets also known as quality control indicates
all of the actions that determine the parameter of the satisfaction of the spreadsheets. Two
aspects are there in quality control are verification and validation. Verification deals with the
programming of the spreadsheet models, and validations deal with the meaningfulness of the
models. Verification is an evaluation of the model&#39;s accuracy that arose the question of
whether the spreadsheets contain errors in the programming or not. On the other hand,
validation is the evaluation of the program&#39;s quality.
6. Debugging: This paradigm is used to modify the unsatisfactory data of the programming of
the spreadsheets and helps to fix it. Debugging in spreadsheet engineering shows that it is a
complex contingent logic programmed associated with the lookup formulas and nested the IF

formulas. Spreadsheet engineering needs changes so that it can function in an accurate,
effective, and efficient way.
7. Documentation: Records written into spreadsheets are known as documentation, mostly
seen in rows and columns. Documentation can be in the forms of rows and columns, like
notes on the columns and labels of the columns, or in the form of separate full-fledged
manuals on the spreadsheets.
8. Usage: spreadsheets can be used by one or multiple users. Usage of the sheets can be done
by developers, researchers, and other individuals. This is the process of providing and
observing the data by the users.
9. Modification: terms included in the modification paradigm of spreadsheet engineering are
maintenance of the sheets, enhancement of the sheets, and at the last extension.
